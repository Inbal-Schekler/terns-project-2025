# Tern Colony Monitoring System

Automated system for detecting, counting, and mapping breeding seabirds at the Atlit colony (Israel), focusing on two endangered species: the **Common Tern** (*Sterna hirundo*) and the **Little Tern** (*Sternula albifrons*).

The system uses two PTZ cameras to scan the colony automatically, downloads the recordings from an NVR server, converts them to images, and runs a deep-learning pipeline to count and track terns. A second pipeline for detecting dead chicks is currently in development.

For a detailed description of the methods and results, see our paper.

The first two steps (scanning and video-to-image conversion) are **shared** — they feed into both the BreedingBirds and Chicks pipelines. After that, each pipeline follows its own analysis path.

## Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** (Anaconda recommended) with packages: `requests`, `opencv-python`, `ultralytics`
- **FFmpeg** installed at `C:\ffmpeg\bin\ffmpeg.exe`
- **Windows** (Task Scheduler is used for automation)
- Camera credentials stored in `RealCoordinatesCalculator/new_camera.ini` (not committed — see format at the bottom of this file)

---

## Step 0 — One-Time Setup: Automate Scanning and Download

Both the camera scan and the video download are fully automated via Windows Task Scheduler. Run each setup script **once** and they will run every day without manual intervention.

### 0a. Scan automation — `RealCoordinatesCalculator/`

**Script:** `setup_scan_tasks.ps1`  
Right-click → *Run with PowerShell*. This registers two daily tasks:

| Task | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `TernScan_Morning` | 10:01 daily | Runs `run_scan.py` → full scan at 10:01:50 |
| `TernScan_Afternoon` | 15:01 daily | Runs `run_scan.py` → full scan at 15:01:50 |

`run_scan.py` controls the south camera (181) via ONVIF. Each time it runs, it performs **two complete scan passes** with a 5.5-minute rest between them, so each video recording contains two extractable tours. The north camera (191) has its own internal schedule.

**Scan structure per session:**
- Pass 1 → Tour 1 (32 flags × 15s) + 10s gap + Tour 2 (15 flags × 15s) ≈ 12 min
- Rest: 329 seconds (~5.5 min)
- Pass 2 → same as Pass 1 ≈ 12 min
- Total: ~38 minutes per session

> **Note:** `new_camera.ini` must be present in `RealCoordinatesCalculator/` before running. See the Camera Connection section at the bottom.

### 0b. Download automation — `ConvertVideoToImage/`

**Script:** `setup_download_task.ps1`  
Right-click → *Run with PowerShell*. This registers two daily tasks:

| Task | Trigger | What it does |
|------|---------|--------------|
| `TernsCameraDownload_1030` | 10:30 daily | Downloads yesterday's scans for both cameras |
| `TernsCameraDownload_1530` | 15:30 daily | Same — catches any retries |

**Script:** `extrac_scans_auto.py`

Downloads scan videos from the NVR server (Nx Witness) for each camera:

| Camera | Retention on NVR | Days downloaded per run |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| North (191) | ~1 day | 1 |
| South (181) | ~7 days | 7 |

The script skips files that already exist, so it is safe to run daily for both cameras. Videos are saved to:
```
F:\My Drive\tern_project\terns_movies\{year}\{camera_name}\
```

The south camera (181) delivers HEVC from the NVR and is automatically transcoded to H.264 (using FFmpeg) so files are seekable and play on all software.

---

## Step 1 — Video to Images — `ConvertVideoToImage/`

**Notebook:** `run_video_converter_2025.ipynb`

Converts each scan video into a folder of images, one image per second per flag position, organized by tour.

### How it works

The converter uses a **time-based approach**: it reads the scan start time from the video filename, then skips through the video using calibrated timing values (dwell time per flag, camera movement time between flags). This replaced an older YOLO-based motion detection approach and is more reliable.

Each video produces:
```
ImagesDir/
└── atlitcam181.stream_2025_05_23_10_01_50/
    ├── tour0/
    │   ├── flag92_0_....jpg
    │   ├── flag92_1_....jpg
    │   └── ...
    └── tour1/
        └── ...
```

### Configuration — `tours_details.json`

Before running, set the paths and verify the camera parameters in `tours_details.json`:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `videos_dir` | Path to downloaded scan videos |
| `images_dir` | Output path for extracted images |
| `flags_ids` | Ordered list of flag numbers visited in one scan pass |
| `margin_till_1st_tour` | Seconds to skip at the start of the video before the first tour begins |
| `magin_between_tours` | Seconds to skip in the video between tour 0 and tour 1 |

> **Important:** `magin_between_tours` must match `GAP_BETWEEN_SCANS` in `run_scan.py` (currently 329 seconds). If you change the rest gap in the scan script, update this value too.

### Running

1. Open `ConvertVideoToImage/run_video_converter_2025.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab
2. Update `videos_dir` and `images_dir` in `tours_details.json`
3. Run all cells

---

## Step 2 — YOLO Detection — `BreedingBirds/YoloDetector/`

**Notebook:** `yolo_runner.ipynb`

Runs a trained YOLOv8 model on the extracted images to detect terns. Results are saved per image for use in the tracking step.

**Configuration:** `yolo_runner.ini`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dates` | Dates to process |
| `images_dir` | Path to images from Step 1 |
| `result_dir` | Output path for YOLO detection results |
| `images_chunk_size` | Number of images per batch |

---

## Step 3 — Single-Scan Tracking — `BreedingBirds/TrackingTerns/`

**Notebook:** `track_scan_runner.ipynb`

Tracks individual terns across the images of one scan, linking detections into tracks.

**Configuration:** `track_scan_runner.ini`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `dates` | Dates to process |
| `yolo_result_dir` | Path to YOLO results from Step 2 |
| `tracker_result_dir` | Output path for single-scan tracks |

---

## From here: choose your pipeline

---

## Breeding Birds Pipeline — `BreedingBirds/`

### Option A — Daily Tern Count

**Step 4A: `BreedingBirds/ClassifyTerns/daily_count_terns.ipynb`**

Classifies and counts terns across all scans of one day. Aggregates results from multiple scan tracks.

**Configuration:** `daily_count_terns.ini`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `date` | Date to process |
| `classifier_model` | Path to trained classifier model |
| `tracker_result_dir` | Path to single-scan tracking results |
| `labels_distribution` | Path to label distribution statistics file |

---

### Option B — Breeding Tern Detection (multi-scan)

**Step 4B: `BreedingBirds/ClassifyTerns/classify_terns.ipynb`**

Classifies single-scan tracks. Uses YOLO outputs, track size (in cm), and location distribution as features.

**Configuration:** `classify_terns.ini`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `date` | Date to process |
| `classifier_model` | Path to trained classifier model |
| `one_scan_result_dir` | Path to single-scan tracking results |
| `classification_result_dir` | Output path for classification results |
| `labels_distribution` | Path to label distribution statistics file |

---

**Step 5B: `BreedingBirds/TrackingTerns/track_breeding_terns_runner.ipynb`**

Tracks terns across multiple scans. Breeding terns are identified by spatial fidelity — they return to the same location across scans.

**Configuration:** `track_breeding_terns_runner.ini`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `date` | Date to process |
| `one_scan_result_dir` | Path to single-scan tracking results |
| `mult_scans_result_dir` | Output path for multi-scan tracking results |
| `classification_result_dir` | Path to classification results |
| `video_converter_dir` | Path to images directory |

---

**Step 6B: `BreedingBirds/FinalResults/report_breeding_terns.ipynb`**

Classifies and counts breeding terns using multi-scan tracking data. Applies overlap correction between camera positions.

**Configuration:** `report_breeding_terns.ini`

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `date` | Date to process |
| `breeding_tracks_dir` | Path to multi-scan tracking results |
| `final_report_dir` | Output path for final report |
| `overlap_areas` | Path to `overlap_areas.json` |

---

## Chicks Pipeline — `Chicks/` *(work in progress)*

This pipeline detects and counts dead chicks in the colony. Steps 0–1 (scanning and video-to-image conversion) are shared with the BreedingBirds pipeline. The analysis notebooks are in `Chicks/` and follow a similar structure.

---

## Camera Calibration — `RealCoordinatesCalculator/`

Each camera flag (preset position) is mapped from camera pixel space to physical coordinates on a drone image of the colony. This mapping is used to calculate bounding box sizes in centimeters and to correct for overlapping fields of view between flags.

See `RealCoordinatesCalculator/README.md` for full details on the calibration process, including the 2026 south camera replacement and recalibration.

Key outputs:
- `PTZCamValues181_mod.txt` — south camera world angles + focal length per flag
- `PTZCamValues191_mod.txt` — north camera world angles + focal length per flag
- `overlap_areas.json` — overlapping areas between flag positions (used in final count)

### Detecting overlaps between flag positions
**Notebook:** `detect_overlaps.ipynb`  
Identifies areas seen by more than one flag, to avoid double-counting terns. Saves results to `overlap_areas.json`.

---

## Model Training

### YOLOv8 — species detection
**Notebook:** `BreedingBirds/yolov8_costum_training.ipynb`  
Fine-tunes YOLOv8 to distinguish Common Terns from Little Terns using physical characteristics.

### Classifier — breeding vs non-breeding
Features used: YOLO outputs, track size (cm), movement rate, detection rate, location probability.

1. Run Steps 1–3 on scans where tagged birds were captured
2. Set parameters in `train_classifier.ini`
3. Open and run `train_classifier.ipynb`
